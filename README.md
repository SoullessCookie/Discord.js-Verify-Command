# Discord.js-Verify-Command

This code will prompt the user to enter a verification code, and then check the code against a database or list of valid codes. If the code is valid, the user will be added to the verified members database and assigned a role. You can modify this code to fit your specific needs and add the other commands for creating and restoring backups.
